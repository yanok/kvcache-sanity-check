# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

`kvcache-sanity-check` validates that an LLM inference server using offloaded KV cache (specifically LMCache) produces **correct outputs**, not just fast ones. Standard benchmarks only measure TTFT and throughput; this tool verifies the model actually answers correctly when KV blocks are partially evicted or recomputed during segmented prefill.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Running the Check

```bash
# Basic run against a local vLLM/LMCache server
kvcache-check --target-url http://localhost:8000 --model meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct

# More iterations to catch flaky failures
kvcache-check --target-url http://localhost:8000 --model <model> --iterations 5

# Use a separate, more capable model as judge
kvcache-check \
  --target-url http://localhost:8000 --model <model> \
  --judge-url http://judge:8001 --judge-model gpt-4o-mini --judge-api-key sk-...

# Verbose: print both answers even on PASS
kvcache-check --target-url http://localhost:8000 --model <model> -v
```

Exits with code 1 if any scenario fails.

## Architecture

```
kvcache_sanity/
  main.py        CLI entry point (Click)
  models.py      Pydantic data models: Document, Scenario, EvaluationResult, TestResult
  corpus.py      Load .txt documents from data/corpus/
  runner.py      Build multi-turn conversations and call the inference server
  evaluator.py   LLM-as-judge comparison between target and reference answers
  report.py      Rich-formatted terminal output

    scenarios/
      default.yaml   Built-in test scenarios
      presets/       Context-length presets (4k/8k/32k/128k.yaml)
    corpus/
      doc_s1_python.txt          ~500 words — Python language history
      doc_s2_coffee.txt          ~600 words — Coffee origins
      doc_m1_apollo.txt          ~1100 words — Apollo space program
      doc_m2_dna.txt             ~1000 words — DNA double helix discovery
      doc_l1_french_revolution.txt  ~1600 words — French Revolution
```

`corpus.py`/`main.py`/`replay.py` resolve `data/` via `importlib.resources`, not `Path(__file__)` — this is what makes the corpus and default scenarios ship inside the installed wheel and still resolve correctly outside a source checkout.

### Evaluation design

1. **Target call** — run the scenario normally; the server may serve from cached KV blocks.
2. **Reference call** — run the same scenario with a UUID injected at the start of the system message (`[<uuid>] You are a helpful assistant…`). Because KV caches are keyed on the full token prefix, any difference in the first token guarantees a complete cache miss and a full recompute.
3. **Judge call** — ask the LLM (same server, another UUID prefix) to compare the two answers and return a JSON score (0–10) and verdict. Pass threshold defaults to 0.7.

Hardcoded assistant acknowledgments are used between document turns so the conversation structure is byte-for-byte identical between target and reference runs — the only variable is the system message prefix.

### Scenario design

Questions are intentionally about **early documents** in the conversation (loaded first → KV blocks computed first → highest eviction risk). Documents are varied enough in topic that accidentally answering about the wrong one is unambiguous.

## Extending

**Add documents** — drop `.txt` files in `kvcache_sanity/data/corpus/`. First line must be `# Title`, remainder is the body.

**Add scenarios** — add entries to `kvcache_sanity/data/scenarios/default.yaml` or pass `--scenarios-file path/to/custom.yaml`.

**Custom corpus** — pass `--corpus-dir`.

**TODO: LMCache fault injection** — integrate with the LMCache control API to programmatically vary the KV eviction/failure rate and sweep quality-vs-eviction-rate curves. This would let the tool drive the failure rate rather than just observe it, enabling systematic characterization of the degradation boundary.
